I had so much fun creating this website, I was able to understand and practice many concepts such as:

- Async await functions
- Fetching data from a site
- Promises

I focused on understanding those concepts and applying the Single Responsibility principle from SOLID to my code, because of that, I didn't focus on the CSS layout of the project that much, but I'll be posting improvements soon.
